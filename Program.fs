let factA x =
    let rec aux acc =
        function
        | 0 -> acc
        | x -> aux (x * acc) (x - 1)

    aux 1 x

(* TODO: *)
(* Compare the running time between factA and factC. Which solution is faster and why?

(* Exercise 5.5 *)

let fibW x =
    let mutable res1 = 0
    let mutable res2 = 1
    let mutable i = 1
    while (i <= x) do
        let temp = res1
        res1 <- res2
        res2 <- temp + res2
        i <- i + 1
    res1

(* TODO: *)
(* Compare the running time of fibW, fibA and fibC

(* Exercise 5.6 *)

let rec bigListK c =
    function
    | 0 -> c []
    | n -> bigListK (fun res -> 1 :: c res) (n - 1)

(* TODO *)
(* The call bigListK id 130000 causes a stack overflow. 
   Analyse the problem and describe exactly why this happens. 
   Why is this not an iterative function?
